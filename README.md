# indigo-irrigationcaddy-plugin

An Irrigation Caddy plugin for the Indigo home automation platform.

Note: this plugin does not present Irrigation Caddy controllers as standard Indigo sprinklers, therefore there is no built-in UI to control them (since they are custom devices).

## Indigo Domotics note 2017/12/08

The original author of this plugin is no longer actively maintaining it. With his permission, we’ve forked his repository into our open source repo, bumped the version number, and added it to the plugin store. We will not be maintaining this plugin, but anyone who is interested in making updates is more than welcome to do so. We’ll accept any pull requests after a cursory code review just to make sure the change doesn’t do anything malicious.

If you are interested in taking over maintenance, please let us know and we’ll gladly give you direct management permissions.

Indigo Domotics doesn't guarantee that this plugin works. We are only hosting the project here in our open source repository for Indigo plugins.
